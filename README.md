This is the first The Odin Project where I will practice all of the knowledge acquired in the HTML portion of the foundations course. The project will be a basic recipe website that uses HTML only and consists of the following:
- Main Index Page
- Links to a few recipes

The HTML that was used to complete the project is the following:
-<h>,<p>, and <a> tags
-attributes such as <href>
